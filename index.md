# Goal of the Project

Alzheimer’s Disease is a common form of dementia that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. In the
United States, more than 5 million people aged 65 and over suffer from the disease. The estimated national cost
of patient care for Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia was $236 billion in 2016. Specifically, the cost of
brain imagings such as PET and MRI in the process of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) diagnosis is very expensive.
So we want to determine the effectiveness of different testing methods so that AD patients can be relatively
accurately diagnosed with as few number of tests as possible. In other words, for this project, we aim to
determine the performance of different testing methods for AD.

Furthermore, we would like to take one step further and find out the most significant groups of
predictors in predicting the diagnosis for patients. To do that, we will first perform bootstrap and find out the most significant predictors by computing confidence interval. We will also perform forward and backward selection to find out the most significant predictors. Then we will compare the results of those methods to see if any common predictors are existed and rank them by significance. If some patterns are found, insignificant testing methods in the diagnose process can be eliminated and thus diagnosing can be more efficient for both patients and doctors.

So the objective of this project is to build a data-driven model for Alzheimer’s Disease using patient
demographic information, medical records, brain imaging data and other related data to predict the diagnosis of
patients, particularly focusing on the problem discussed above. We will first investigate through common topics
including finding the major causes of Alzheimer’s and evaluating the risk based on predictors. Then our main
goal is to perform several advanced analysis on the dataset trying to answer the questions we raised above.
